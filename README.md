# Music Player

This music player app finds music either stored locally on device or on external storage, groups them and enables users to browse and listen to their favorite music. When a song is selected, it automatically finds its lyrics online and displays it on application screen for user to read. Songs can be shuffled and playlists can be set to play on repeat. Selected song can be played, paused, rewond and added to favorites list which can later be accessed.
This project is still in process of developing. I plan to implement deleting songs, creating user's own custom playlists and saving lyrics to disc so that it works offline too.
